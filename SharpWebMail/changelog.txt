 - Released as version 0.9b (317)

11/04/2004

   identifier instead of by culture name.

10/27/2004
 - Added Portuguese (Brazil) translation. Thanks to Christian Emil Hoh.
 - [Address Book] If the connection username is not configured, it tries to connect using
   the username and password for the current session. This allows per user authentication
   of the search queries.
 - [Address Book] Implemented OLEDB and ODBC queries.

10/25/2004
 - Bugfix: LDAP search was not being performed due to a try-catch wrongly added.
 - Written a configuration handler, so it's now possible to write more flexible sections.
   The config file is incompatible with previous ones. (the only needed change is replacing
   the "configSections" section by the new one, the real config is the same).
 - Now it is possible to configure multiple Address Books.
 - If one of the Address Books has configured a special query (SearchStringRealName), the
   real name of the user will be looked up executing that query. The UserName as authenticated
   by the mail server, is replaced in that query.
 - In the query for getting the address book content, the UserName as authenticated by the mail
   server, is replaced in the query.

10/24/2004
 - The culture names in login page are now sorted.
 - Make the input boxes of newmessage page larger.

   and presents the results in a paged table. By clicking on an entry it's added to the
   'To' input box.
 - Adjust sleeps of the tcp client.
 - The messages' headers are now parsed after the mail session has finished instead of
   parsing each one after retrieved.

10/22/2004

   smaller

10/09/2004

   mail server were causing login failures to the client.

10/07/2004
 - Added Vietnamese translation. Thanks to Pham Vu Dung.

10/05/2004
 - Now it is possible to select the language of the interface in the login screen.

10/02/2004
 - Updated cultures_neutral.txt and cultures_specific.txt to reflect .NET 1.1 SP1
   changes.
 - Changed the logic in language selection code. Now if none of the accepted languajes
   of the client can be parsed, or aren't supported, the default_lang setting is used.
   If it is configured to something not available then english is used.

09/16/2004
 - Version number set to 0.8
 - Added French translation. Thanks to Michel C.
 - After several issues with email servers' uid generation, I've changed the
   use of the uid in all the application. Now it's only used for sanity check while
   getting messages from server. For the rest of the application a random GUID
   is used instead.
 - Fix: Alternative languages sent by browsers were not being parsed properly.
 
09/13/2004
 - FCKEditor updated to version 2.0 beta 2.

08/17/2004
 - Fix: Small speedup reading of network data. Avoids unnecessary tests to find
   command ends when there is data available for reading.
 - Fix: Generic tcpclient now determines the response end in a way more compatible
   with imap responses.
 - Fix: randomize tag for imap commands.
 - Released as version 0.6b (260)

08/15/2004
 - Fix: Search code does not rely on transferring Form to the inbox page. This makes
   the search page work in mono.
 - TempFix: Commented the <location> directives added on 07/14/2004 for xsp, as they make
   it throw an exception with search page. With xsp the login page does not load
   images on login page, with mod_mono images as loaded if apache handles these
   queries (mod_mono configured with AddHandler instead of SetHandler).

08/13/2004
 - Workaround a mono bug.
 - Finally I have a mono development box ready.  I've tested everything with
   mono 1.0.1, mod_mono 1.0.1 and apache 2.0.50 and the only unaddressed issue is
   related with the search page (I'll fix this soon).
 - Added Makefile for Mono

08/12/2004
 - Version number set to 0.6

08/11/2004
 - Released as version 0.5b (244)

 - Rewrite the imap client response parsing. Now it's a bit more intelligent.
 - Abstract way of removing command responses from messages streams.
 - The imap client now removes command responses from streams.
 - Bugfix: The timeouts of the tcpclients were too aggressive, big mails on
   slow connections may have trouble.
 - Bugfix: A locking network read was being done without being sure about
   the availability of data.

08/09/2004
 - Improve Imap client.
 - Bugfix: The order of the multiple servers configuration wasn't being followed.

08/08/2004
 - Finished the abstract implementation of the emailclient and the derived pop3client.
 - Finished the imap client. This initial implementation only allows reading messages
   in the inbox of the imap server. Now it needs intensive testing.
 - Some general code cleanups.
 
08/07/2004
 - Started an abstract emailclient implementation, and changed the pop3client as
   a derived class of it.
 - Changes accessibility of pop3client to internal.
 - Started an IMAP client implementation.

08/06/2004
 - Bugfix: In the newmessage page, the validation wasn't working under mono 1.0
 - Bugfix: The validator associated to FCKEditor was causing problems under mono 1.0
   I've disabled it conditionally until further investigation (it looks as a FCKEditor
   bug)
 - Email client usage now does not depend on POP3Client, so it is possible to extend
   everything to use other email clients (ex. IMAP). Now only an open source IMAP client
   is needed :)

08/05/2004
 - Bugfix: When sending a message in login_mode 2, the user supplied email was
   being ignored and login name was being used instead.
 - Add: Now multiple servers can be configured for sending and for reading email.
   The selection is based in regular expressions tested against the username. The
   first server which pattern matches is used. Read the config file (web.config)
   for details. The new server selection method allows future additions of other
   protocols.
 - Ensure all config options are set.
 
08/04/2004
 - Added Danish translation. Thanks to Claus Witt.

08/03/2004
 - Rewritten configuration file. Now it is structured in sections.
 - Now it is possible to set the temp folder for sending and for
   reading messages. This allows disabling them independently.
 - Now the sanitizer can be configured for sending and for reading messages.

07/28/2004
 - Implemented feature 998814 - Added a checkbox column and a delete command to
   the inbox for allowing the deletion of messages without reading them. Messages
   go to trash folder just as when deleted from readmessage page.
 - The email format chooser in newmessage page tries to find the editor by name and
   if it fails it tries by index. This fixes a small issue with gecko browsers.

07/22/2004
 - Version number set to 0.5
 - Removed some unused js code in newmessage page.

07/21/2004

 - Implemented feature 981655 - "Add capability to send messages in Plain Text"
   Now there is a checkbox that defaults to html where you can choose email format.
   Anyway html messages are sent in both ways so all mail clients should be able to
   choose the format they can understand.
 - Added the resources for the above item
 - Added a validator to email body. Now it is a required field
 - Explicitly allow anonymous access to the CSS and images folder. xsp needs this

07/03/2004

06/31/2004
 - Bugfix: the committed fix for bug 981749 did not compile.

06/30/2004
 - Make sure the message UIDL is what it should be before getting its body.
   (this or other message may have been deleted outside of our webmail session)
 - Start using FCKEditor V2 (Works with gecko powered browsers)
 - Added initial comment tags (without comments)
 - Bugfix: The UIDL was not always being URLEncoded before using it in links

   clicked twice

06/25/2004
 - Compiled successfully under Mono Beta 3 (0.96)

 - Application_Error logs the exception before clearing it.

05/17/2004
 - Implemented a basic HTML sanitizer. It has two modes:
      - CommentBlocks: which tries to comment potentially dangerous tags (or
        just tags that do not make sense on email).
        For now it comments: script, applet, embed, object, layer, ilayer,
        iframe. It also comments everything before and after body
      - RemoveEvents: which tries to convert all JavaScript 1.3 Event Handlers
        into syntactically invalid code
  - When using a paramenter to access the filesystem, make the effort of removing
    chars that are invalid for the local filesystem 
  - Consider everything as dangerous input
