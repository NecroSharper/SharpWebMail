   with the situation.

10/25/2004
 - Bugfix: LDAP search was not being performed due to a try-catch wrongly added.
 - Written a configuration handler, so it's now possible to write more flexible sections.
   The config file is incompatible with previous ones. (the only needed change is replacing

 - Now it is possible to configure multiple Address Books.

10/09/2004

09/16/2004
 - Version number set to 0.8
 - Added French translation. Thanks to Michel C.
 - After several issues with email servers' uid generation, I've changed the
   use of the uid in all the application. Now it's only used for sanity check while

   is used instead.
 - Fix: Alternative languages sent by browsers were not being parsed properly.
 
09/13/2004

   with imap responses.
 - Fix: randomize tag for imap commands.
 - Released as version 0.6b (260)

08/15/2004
 - Fix: Search code does not rely on transferring Form to the inbox page. This makes
   the search page work in mono.
 - TempFix: Commented the <location> directives added on 07/14/2004 for xsp, as they make
   it throw an exception with search page. With xsp the login page does not load
   images on login page, with mod_mono images as loaded if apache handles these
   queries (mod_mono configured with AddHandler instead of SetHandler).

08/13/2004
 - Workaround a mono bug.
 - Finally I have a mono development box ready.  I've tested everything with
   mono 1.0.1, mod_mono 1.0.1 and apache 2.0.50 and the only unaddressed issue is
   related with the search page (I'll fix this soon).
 - Added Makefile for Mono

08/12/2004
 - Version number set to 0.6

08/11/2004

   the availability of data.

08/09/2004
 - Improve Imap client.
 - Bugfix: The order of the multiple servers configuration wasn't being followed.

08/08/2004
 - Finished the abstract implementation of the emailclient and the derived pop3client.
 - Finished the imap client. This initial implementation only allows reading messages
   in the inbox of the imap server. Now it needs intensive testing.
 - Some general code cleanups.
 
08/07/2004
 - Started an abstract emailclient implementation, and changed the pop3client as
   a derived class of it.
 - Changes accessibility of pop3client to internal.

08/06/2004
 - Bugfix: In the newmessage page, the validation wasn't working under mono 1.0
 - Bugfix: The validator associated to FCKEditor was causing problems under mono 1.0
   I've disabled it conditionally until further investigation (it looks as a FCKEditor
   bug)
 - Email client usage now does not depend on POP3Client, so it is possible to extend
   everything to use other email clients (ex. IMAP). Now only an open source IMAP client
   is needed :)

08/05/2004
 - Bugfix: When sending a message in login_mode 2, the user supplied email was
   being ignored and login name was being used instead.
 - Add: Now multiple servers can be configured for sending and for reading email.
   The selection is based in regular expressions tested against the username. The
   first server which pattern matches is used. Read the config file (web.config)
   for details. The new server selection method allows future additions of other
   protocols.
 - Ensure all config options are set.
 
08/04/2004
 - Added Danish translation. Thanks to Claus Witt.

08/03/2004
 - Rewritten configuration file. Now it is structured in sections.

   reading messages. This allows disabling them independently.

07/28/2004
 - Implemented feature 998814 - Added a checkbox column and a delete command to
   the inbox for allowing the deletion of messages without reading them. Messages
   go to trash folder just as when deleted from readmessage page.
 - The email format chooser in newmessage page tries to find the editor by name and
   if it fails it tries by index. This fixes a small issue with gecko browsers.

07/22/2004
 - Version number set to 0.5
 - Removed some unused js code in newmessage page.

07/21/2004

 - Implemented feature 981655 - "Add capability to send messages in Plain Text"

   Anyway html messages are sent in both ways so all mail clients should be able to
   choose the format they can understand.
 - Added the resources for the above item
 - Added a validator to email body. Now it is a required field
 - Explicitly allow anonymous access to the CSS and images folder. xsp needs this

06/31/2004
 - Bugfix: the committed fix for bug 981749 did not compile.

 - Start using FCKEditor V2 (Works with gecko powered browsers)
 - Added initial comment tags (without comments)
 - Bugfix: The UIDL was not always being URLEncoded before using it in links

   clicked twice

06/25/2004

        into syntactically invalid code
