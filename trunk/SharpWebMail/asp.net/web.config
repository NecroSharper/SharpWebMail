					restrictions as when provided manually. The querystring items used are
					username and password. Possible values:
						true-> enabled
						false-> disabled

					Note: Be careful when using this option as the passwords will be seen in
						clear text easily (for example in the browser history).

				The <inbox> section is used to configure options that control the inbox page.
					pagesize: Number of mails per page
					stat: Determines how to handle queries to email server when inbox page is visited.
						The queries are used to update the list of available messages on the server.
						(default value: 2)
						1-> Query the server on every visit to inbox page.
						2-> Query the server only when refresh button is pressed or when it's
							necessary to get uncached message details.
					sort: Sets the default sort expression for the inbox. The value must be the column name
						followed by "ASC" (ascending) or "DESC" (descending). Columns are sorted
						ascending by default. Multiple columns can be separated by commas.
						Columns names that can be used: msgnum, Size, uidl, From, FromName, To, Subject, Date. 
						(Default value: msgnum DESC)
						
						Important Note: Only msgnum, Size or uidl should be used, as they are the only values that
						are 'cheap' to obtain. In order to have the other columns available for sorting purposes,
						the message headers of all the messages in your inbox must be retrieved and parsed from your
						mail server. In normal operation only the messages that are going to be displayed in one inbox
						page are retrieved. So in case your users have big mailboxes, it's not a good idea to change this.
						It would be a better idea to use a mail server that generates the message numbers in the desired way.
					commit_onexit: If true, when the user performs a logout, all messages marked for deletion are deleted from the email server.
						(Default value: true)
					commit_ondelete: If true, when the user deletes a message from the inbox page, it's deleted from the email server.
						Otherwise, the message is marked for deletion. (Default value: false)

					regexp:	Regular expressions tested against the username to decide.
							The first that matches against the username is used. In order to
							configure a default value, the latest entry should be "*" or ".*".
							This option is optional unless you set serverselection to auto.
					protocol: Valid protocols are: pop3, imap.
					host: Host name or ip address of the mail server.
					port: Port number.

					UseServerEncoding:  If UseServerEncoding is set to true, then instead of using the RFC 2045 default
						(us-ascii) it will use the default encoding configured in the server. (Default value: false)
						This is only related to content that does not have the appropriate header parameter mandating other
						encoding. OE, yahoo, and others are known to not issue appropriate RFC 2045 header under some configurations
						so this setting may allow better decoding e-mail generated by them.

            The <sessionState" section is used to configure session state for the application.

            later two modes enable session state to be stored off the web server machine - 
            allowing failure redundancy and web farm session state scenarios.
